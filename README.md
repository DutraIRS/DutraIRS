### 👨‍💻 Professional Summary
I am a Data Scientist specializing in **Causal Machine Learning**, **Agentic AI**, and **Graph Neural Networks**. Currently completing an MSc in Mathematical Modeling at FGV (Accelerated Track), I focus on building production-grade inference pipelines that solve complex high-stakes problems.

My background bridges advanced statistical theory with software engineering, moving beyond notebooks to deploy scalable systems using **Docker**, **GCP**, and **PyTorch**.

### 🚀 Key Highlights
* **Production Causal ML:** Designed a supply-chain early-warning system at **Otrafy**, utilizing Causal ML to detect supplier regulatory risks.
* **Agentic Systems:** Engineered an autonomous framework using **LangChain** that reduced legislative compliance verification time from hours to under 30 seconds.
* **Global Forecasting:** Delivered the **#1 global forecast accuracy** (ranked by FiveThirtyEight) for the 2024 Brazil and USA electoral cycles at **AtlasIntel**.
* **Biomedical Research:** Currently developing explainable GNN models for drug side-effect prediction (MSc Thesis).
